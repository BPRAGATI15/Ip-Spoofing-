# Ip-Spoofing-
This Python script generates random IPv4 addresses and simulates processing each with a 10-second delay. It uses basic functions to generate and process IPs one at a time, with the process_ip function as a placeholder for custom logic. Itâ€™s useful for simulating network traffic, testing systems, or learning IP handling in Python.
